### Outdated Model and Better Bots Available on GitHub

This is just a very small example. The code itself is not wrong but it relies on an outdated model, and newer versions such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are now available. If you're looking for more advanced bots, I recommend checking out the models available on GitHub.
